## Key Improvements Delivered

### 1. Simplified Architecture
**Before (PydanticAI)**:
```python
# Complex dependency injection patterns
@dataclass
class AgentDependencies:
    http_client: AsyncClient
    config: AgentConfig
    logger: Logger
    vault_path: Path

@agent.tool
async def create_note(ctx: RunContext[AgentDependencies], filename: str) -> str:
    return await create_obsidian_note_tool(ctx.deps, filename)
```

**After (Strands)**:
```python
# Simple, clean tool definitions
@tool
async def create_note(filename: str, content: str, folder: str = None) -> str:
    """Create a new note in the Obsidian vault."""
    return await create_obsidian_note(filename, content, folder)
```

### 2. Native MCP Integration
**Before**: Custom MCP server management with manual context handling  
**After**: Strands' built-in MCP support with automatic discovery and health monitoring

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
**Before**: Gradio interface with limited streaming  
**After**: Modern Streamlit interface with real-time streaming and responsive design

### 4. Model Flexibility
**Before**: Complex provider switching with custom implementations  
**After**: Seamless model switching across AWS Bedrock, Anthropic, and OpenAI

## Technical Achievements
