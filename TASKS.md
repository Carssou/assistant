### Task 1.4: Fork and Fix Obsidian MCP Server ✅ COMPLETED 2025-06-22

**Priority**: High
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### Background:
The original `obsidian-mcp` package has a tool naming convention mismatch with PydanticAI:
- MCP server registers tools with hyphens: `list-available-vaults`
- PydanticAI converts them to underscores: `list_available_vaults`
- Package is unmaintained (6 months without updates)

#### Subtasks:

- [x] Fork obsidian-mcp repository from https://github.com/StevenStavrakis/obsidian-mcp ✅ 2025-06-22
- [x] Create new package `obsidian-mcp-pydanticai` ✅ 2025-06-22
- [x] Update project configuration to use new package ✅ 2025-06-22
- [x] Identify and fix tool naming convention issues ✅ 2025-06-22
- [x] Test tool name compatibility with PydanticAI ✅ 2025-06-22
- [x] Publish fixed package to npm ✅ 2025-06-22
- [x] Verify all 11 tools work correctly ✅ 2025-06-22
- [x] Test end-to-end note operations through agent ✅ 2025-06-22

#### Package Information:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/Carssou/obsidian-mcp-pydanticai
- **Package Name**: `obsidian-mcp-pydanticai`
- **Configuration**: `npx -y obsidian-mcp-pydanticai /path/to/vault`

#### Expected Fix:
Ensure MCP server accepts both naming conventions:
- `list-available-vaults` (original format)
- `list_available_vaults` (PydanticAI format)

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Fork created and project configured to use new package ✅
- [x] Forked MCP server accepts PydanticAI tool name format ✅
- [x] All note operations work through agent conversation ✅
- [x] Real vault integration fully functional ✅
- [x] Agent can perform meaningful note management tasks ✅
